## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Leadership Philosophy

Across evaluations and peer references, a consistent leadership philosophy emerges:

- **Develop people to think for themselves.** From his first year as TL, Ryan's stated approach was to help specialists develop autonomy, speak up, and contribute — not just execute instructions.
- **Challenge, then support.** He sets high expectations and challenges people past their perceived limits, but follows through with coaching, recognition, and follow-up.
- **Make the invisible visible.** Consistently advocates for surfacing work that metrics don't capture — whether in specialist performance reviews, project impact reports, or knowledge base audits.
- **Build systems, not just solutions.** Whether restructuring AD groups, designing BCP frameworks, or building KO health monitors, he consistently designs for scale and sustainability.
- **Value over effort.** A consistent stakeholder feedback theme is his push to evaluate initiatives based on actual value vs. effort — prioritizing impact over activity.
