- Designed structured escalation frameworks for aged, VIP, and high-risk incidents
- Reduced workflow cycle times by 30–50% through backlog governance and sprint-based improvement

### 3. Quality Assurance & Backlog Stabilization
- Established a structured 2-FTE QA governance function
- Reduced aged tickets by 90%
- Increased first-contact resolution to 90%
- Improved operational hygiene and SLA stability

### 4. Cross-Functional Improvement Leadership
- Built and led a 15-member cross-functional Continuous Improvement Squad
- Applied sprint planning, backlog management, and structured retrospectives
